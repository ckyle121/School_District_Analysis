## School District Summary 
Replacing the ninth grade reading scores had three affects of the school district summary. Foremost, displaying the math and reading scores by grade increases with the addition of Thomas High School ninth graders. Additionally, it increases the average scores by school spending and scores by school size and per student school spending. It additionally increases the results for the charter schools in school type. We see that Thomas High School becomes one of the top high schools in the distrcit after correcting the ninth graders scores.
